"""
account.move extension: bump the per company move version counter on state
changes. Drives reporting cache invalidation.

Hooks the write() method rather than _post() so every state transition
(post, draft, cancel) participates uniformly. Posting is implemented via
write({'state': 'posted'}) under the hood, so this single hook covers all
transitions without missing edge cases.

account.move.line extension: a posted move can still have its lines edited
in an unlocked period (the framework only blocks this when a period lock
covers the line date). Such an edit changes report figures without any
state transition, so the state-only hook above would let the reporting
cache serve a stale payload. The line write() hook below bumps the counter
whenever a financially-material field (amount, account, or date) changes on
a line whose parent move is posted, and only then, so unrelated writes
(analytic tags, narration, reconciliation bookkeeping) do not over-bump.

Adding a new line to, or removing an existing line from, an already-posted
move likewise changes report figures with no state transition. The line
create() and unlink() hooks below bump the counter whenever the affected
line belongs to a posted move, and only then, so building up a draft entry
before action_post does not over-bump.
