"""
eh.account.dynamic.report: the orchestrator model.

One record per concrete report (Trial Balance, P&L, Balance Sheet, ...).
The handler_model field references the AbstractModel that knows how to
compute that report. The render() method:

1. Computes the cache key from the options dict.
2. Looks up a prior successful execution with the same key. If the move
   version counter is unchanged since that execution, the cached payload
   is fresh and is returned directly.
3. On cache miss, instantiates the handler, runs compute(), persists the
   payload on a fresh execution row, and returns it.

Both paths return the same shape so callers cannot tell hit from miss
unless they inspect the from_cache flag.
