Cash Flow Statement handler (direct method).

Classifies cash movements into operating, investing, and financing
activities by inspecting the non cash counterparts of each cash affecting
move. The direct method was chosen for v1 because it is more transparent
to SMB readers than the indirect method (which starts from net income and
adjusts), and because it composes naturally with the SQL builder.

Algorithm:

1. Find all moves that have at least one cash account line in the period.
2. For those moves, aggregate non cash line balances by account_type. The
   cash impact attributable to each account_type is SUM(-balance). Because
   each move balances, the sum of -balance over non cash lines equals the
   sum of balance over cash lines.
3. Group account_type buckets into the three activity sections.
4. Add a Net Change line, Opening Cash, Closing Cash, and a Balance Check.

The Balance Check verifies the identity:

    Closing Cash = Opening Cash + Net Change in Cash + FX Effect

If non zero, the underlying ledger has unbalanced postings or there is a
filter inconsistency, and the line surfaces this immediately.

FX effect on cash (IAS 7.28): journal entries posted in the company's
designated exchange difference journal that revalue cash accounts are not
activity; they restate the measurement of cash already held. Those moves
are pulled out of the activity sections and presented on their own
"Effect of exchange rate changes on cash" line, after the three activity
sections and before the closing cash balance. When the books carry no
such postings the line is zero and hidden, and the output is identical
to the pre-FX behaviour.

Cash and cash equivalents (IAS 7.6/7.46): companies can mark short term,
highly liquid investment accounts as cash equivalents on res.company
(eh_cash_equivalent_account_ids). Those accounts are then treated as cash
throughout: movements between real cash and equivalents net out as pure
cash transfers, and equivalent balances count towards opening and closing
cash. Left empty (the default), only `asset_cash` accounts are cash.

Indirect method (IAS 7.18(b)/7.20): the operating section is derived, not
classified. It starts from profit before tax (the period total of every
P&L account, plus back the income tax expense identified by the company's
Tax Expense account mapping and/or the EH Income Tax Paid tag), adjusts
for finance costs and investment income (so the disclosed interest and
dividend flows can be presented gross further down), adds back non-cash
charges resolved from the EH Non-Cash account tags (depreciation /
amortisation, impairment, provisions, unrealised FX, fair value), applies
the working-capital deltas measured from the balance-sheet movement of the
receivable / payable / other-current groups, and closes with the IAS
7.31-35 disclosed flows (interest paid, income taxes paid, and whichever
disclosed items the presentation policy assigns to operating).

The add-back engine is exact, not approximate: for every non-cash journal
entry carrying a tagged (or `expense_depreciation`-typed) P&L line, the
add-back equals that entry's movement on non-current balance-sheet
accounts. An accrual whose counterpart is itself a working-capital account
(a provision credited to a current liability, say) therefore contributes
no add-back - its cash effect is already inside the working-capital delta
- and the operating total of the indirect method ties exactly to the
direct method's operating total on the same ledger. That tie is asserted
as a test invariant.

IAS 7.31-35 disclosures: interest paid / received, dividends paid /
received and income taxes paid are measured from the tagged lines (EH
Interest Paid, EH Interest Received, EH Dividends Paid, EH Dividends
Received, EH Income Tax Paid) of cash-affecting entries, presented on
dedicated lines, and removed from the aggregate account-type buckets so
nothing is counted twice. Where a flow settles through an accrual account
(interest payable, income tax payable), tag that clearing account too:
the report reads the actual cash settlement off it and excludes it from
the working-capital deltas. When no account carries the EH Income Tax
Paid tag, an OPT-IN fallback (company flag eh_cf_tax_fallback, or the
cf_income_tax_fallback render option) measures the line from the
accounts named as tax repartition targets (the tax-authority payables
that core Odoo posts tax to), counting settlement lines only - lines of
cash-affecting entries that reduce the payable - so tax accrued inside a
cash entry (a POS session closing, a cash sale with tax) never surfaces
as a disclosed amount. The fallback cannot distinguish income tax from
indirect taxes (VAT / GST remittances qualify), applies to the direct
method's presentation only (see Limitations), and is off by default so
an untagged book renders byte-identically to a build without the
feature. Entities wanting income tax isolated should tag explicitly.
The presentation section per item follows IAS 7.31's policy choices,
defaulted on the company (interest paid: operating; interest / dividends
received: operating; dividends paid: financing) and overridable per
render via options; income taxes paid is always operating (IAS 7.35).

Non-cash transactions (IAS 7.43): entries recorded in the
eh.noncash.transaction register are listed in a memo section at the foot
of the statement for every period containing their date. Memo only: the
amounts never feed the net change in cash.

Limitations:

* Credit cards (`liability_credit_card`) are treated as financing rather
  than cash.
* The FX effect line applies to the direct method only. Under the
  indirect method the FX gain or loss already flows through net income,
  so isolating it there would double count.
* The indirect/direct operating tie assumes non-cash P&L charges against
  non-current balance-sheet accounts are tagged. An untagged non-cash
  entry crossing P&L and a non-current account (or a credit purchase of
  a fixed asset - itself an IAS 7.43 register candidate) surfaces as a
  difference between the two methods.
* The opt-in income-taxes-paid fallback (tax repartition targets) is a
  direct-method presentation aid only: it cannot distinguish income tax
  from indirect taxes, and the indirect method deliberately ignores it -
  no disclosed line, and the fallback accounts stay inside the
  working-capital deltas - so the operating total keeps its exact tie to
  the direct method (excluding them while still deducting the disclosed
  settlement would break the tie by the remittance amount, since a
  VAT-shaped accrual never crosses P&L). Tag the income tax accounts
  explicitly for a disclosed line under the indirect method.

        Detection is the union of two independent seams; a move qualifies if
        EITHER matches, so a book can be picked up by nominated journal, by
        counterpart account, or by both without double counting.

        1. Journal seam: journal entries posted in the company's designated
           exchange difference journal (currency_exchange_journal_id), plus
           any configured cash revaluation journal
           (eh_cash_fx_revaluation_journal_id), that carry at least one cash
           line in the period. The extra revaluation journal is included
           because core Odoo posts no cash line into
           currency_exchange_journal_id on AR/AP settlement, so a bank / cash
           revaluation run posted elsewhere would otherwise be missed and leak
           into the opening-to-closing difference while the FX line stayed
           zero. Left unconfigured, only currency_exchange_journal_id is used.

        2. Counterpart seam (journal-agnostic): moves that carry both a cash
           line AND a line on one of the company's exchange gain/loss accounts
           (income_currency_exchange_account_id /
           expense_currency_exchange_account_id). This catches a stock-Odoo
           bank revaluation posted to an ordinary bank journal, which the
           journal seam alone misses, without requiring any nominated journal.

        For every qualifying move the FX effect is the sum of that move's
        cash-line balances; the move ids are returned so the caller can pull
        them out of the activity sections.

        Returns (fx_effect, fx_move_ids). Companies with neither an exchange
        journal nor exchange gain/loss accounts configured, or with no such
        postings, yield (0.0, []) and the report is unchanged.
